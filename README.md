## Instructions

#### Employees Database
1. Find the average salary of the male and female employees in each department.

2. Find the lowest department number encountered in the 'dept_emp' table. Then, find the highest department number.

3. Obtain a table containing the following three fields for all individuals whose employee number is not greater than 10040:
	  - employee number
	  - the lowest department number among the departments where the employee has worked in
	  - assign '110022' as 'manager' to all individuals whose employee number is lower than or equal to 10020, and '110039' to those whose number is between 10021 and 10040 inclusive.

4. Retrieve a list of all employees that have been hired in 2000.

5. Retrieve a list of all employees from the 'titles' table who are engineers. 
	  - Repeat the exercise, this time retrieving a list of all employees from the 'titles' table who are senior engineers.

6. Create a procedure that asks you to insert an employee number and that will obtain an output containing the same number, as well as the number and name of the last department the employee has worked in.
	  - Finally, call the procedure for employee number 10010.

7. How many contracts have been registered in the 'salaries' table with durations of more than one year and with values higher than or equal to $100,000?

8. Create a trigger that checks if the hire date of an employee is higher than the current date. If true, set the hire date equal to the current date. Format the output appropriately (YY-mm-dd).
	  - Extra challenge: You can try to declare a new variable called 'today' which stores today's data, and then use it in your trigger!
	  - After creating the trigger, execute the following code to see if it's working properly.
		
			INSERT employees 
			VALUES ('999904', '1970-01-31', 'John', 'Johnson', 'M', '2025-01-01');  

			SELECT *
			  FROM employees
			 ORDER BY emp_no DESC;

9. Define a function that retrieves the largest contract salary value of an employee. Apply it to employee number 11356.
	  - In addition, what is the lowest contract salary of the same employee?

10. Based on the previous exercise, you can now try to create a third function that also accepts a second parameter. Let this parameter be a character sequence. Evaluate if its value is 'min' or 'max' and based on that retrieve either the lowest or the highest salary, respectively (using the same logic and code structure from Exercise 9). If the inserted value is any string value different from 'min' or 'max', let the function return the difference between the highest and the lowest salary of that employee.
